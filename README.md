#H3 Building Status
Utilizing Plotly and D3 we read in the API to create our plot that displayed the compensation analysis showing total compensation(Avg) as well as base salary(Avg) and on the timeline for each club.  
Utilizing Plotly, D3 and Chart.js we populated our dropdown list from the database.  This allowed the graph to be responsive to the dropdown list.  Our plot was a boxplot displaying playerâ€™s base salaries for a single season.  In addition there is a mini table summarizing the seasons salaries.

Since we have data from different sources (Data.world & MLSsoccer.com), we realized we needed to join the two datasets using a mapping dictionary. The Salaries table refers to the soccer clubs by their abbreviations while the seasons table uses full names of the clubs. Due to only a few dozen clubs in MLS league the mapping table could easily be composed manually. All that was needed was a "Select" query on unique names and unique abbreviations from the two tables in order to match them together. See the "create table club_map" part in the notebook.
